## Next.js App Router Course - All lessons Included 

I have faced many problems while completing the Next JS [lessons](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/css-styling) , So I have created this repository which has a commit of every lesson 


I know most of you will not have a problem until lesson 5, The only problem might be lesson 6, I initially gave up on that too and started to setup a local database using prisma and sqlite 

If you are unable to move past lesson 6 use the file `SQL_Script.sql` (add the image of vercel query here ) and paste it in run query mode in vercel postgres instance, This will create a database with manual code and you can skip lesson 6 and move to the next one if this doesn't work and you still have problem I would suggest to delete that postgres instance completely and create a new one as your previous queries and uploads might cause conflicts
